\- Openstack-swift object auditor

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-object-auditor 
[CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once] [-z|--zero_byte_fps]

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
The object Auditor basically crawls the local object system checking the integrity 
of objects. If corruption is found (in the case of bit rot, for example), the
file is quarantined, and replication will replace the bad file from another replica.
If other errors are found they are logged and a good replica also retrieved by replication.

The options are as follows:

    -v
    --verbose
    		log to console
    
    -o
    --once
     	only run one pass of daemon
    
    -z ZERO_BYTE_FPS	
    --zero_byte_fps=ZERO_BYTE_FPS
    		Audit only zero byte files at specified files/sec
